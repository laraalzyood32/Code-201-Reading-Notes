What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
 (Links to an external site.)We should not focus only on efficiency but on life at work because the work is more than just labor.
How to Build a Perfect Team

1. The War on Meetings

2. The Case for Blind Hiring

3. Failure to Lunch

4. The 'Good Jobs' Gamble

5. The Post-Cubicle Office

6. The New Dream Jobs they had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The (who) part didn’t seem to matter. As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.

7. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based

8. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction

9. Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams

10. What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others.

11. However, establishing psychological safety is, by its very nature, somewhat messy and difficult to implement.
 # Technology industry
# technology industry is not just one of the fastest growing parts of our economy; it is
 also increasingly the world’s dominant commercial culture. And at the core of Silicon Valley
  are certain self-mythologies and dictums: Everything is different now, data reigns supreme, 
  today’s winners deserve to triumph because they are cleareyed enough to discard 
  yesterday’s conventional wisdoms and search out the disruptive and the new.
  
 #  The paradox, of course, is that Google’s intense data collection and number crunching have 
 led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. In the best teams,
  members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs. The fact that 
  these insights aren’t wholly original doesn’t mean Google’s contributions aren’t valuable.
   In fact, in some ways, the ‘‘employee performance optimization’’ movement has given us 
   a method for talking about our insecurities, fears and aspirations in more constructive ways. 
   It also has given us the tools to quickly teach lessons that once took managers
    decades to absorb. Google, in other words, in its race to build the perfect team,
     has perhaps unintentionally demonstrated the usefulness of imperfection and done
      what Silicon Valley does best: figure out how to create psychological safety faster, 
      better and in more productive ways.
